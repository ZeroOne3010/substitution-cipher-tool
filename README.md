Substitution cipher tool
========================

This is an HTML &amp; JavaScript based tool for solving simple substitution ciphers. 
In a simple substitution cipher each letter is replaced with another. ROT13 and
Caesar ciphers are special cases of substitution ciphers where the alphabet is just
shifted (by 13 and 3 places, respectively) but not shuffled in any other way. Using
this tool it is easy to try various substitution alphabets and to see the resulting
plaintext immediately. This tool does not support solving Vigen√®re ciphers or any 
other polyalphabetic ciphers.
